# Project Context

## Field Ownership

- Human owns product intent, priority overrides, and unresolved product decisions.
- AI owns concise implementation-state refreshes, evidence links, and next-step recommendations.
- This context does not silently override approved scope in the product spec or phase files.

## Current Status

- Status: PHASE-001 execution is underway with Go runtime/API foundation, PostgreSQL migrations, S3 adapter, backend identity, mobile-first PWA shell, local Compose stack, offline/auth browser proof, Compose web API proxy, and backend/frontend folder split implemented.
- Active backlog: [BL-001](work/BACKLOG.md)
- Current queue focus: execute PHASE-002 finance core, starting with TICKET-005 wallet/category domain.
- Active phase: [PHASE-002 Finance Core](work/phases/PHASE-002-finance-core.md), status `ready`.
- Active ticket: [TICKET-001](work/tickets/TICKET-001-repository-runtime-foundation.md), status `verified`; [TICKET-002](work/tickets/TICKET-002-postgresql-migrations-s3-platform-adapters.md), status `verified`; [TICKET-003](work/tickets/TICKET-003-google-oauth-user-isolation.md), status `verified`; [TICKET-004](work/tickets/TICKET-004-development-operations-verification-baseline.md), status `verified`.
- Active bug: None.

## Current Focus

Execute PHASE-002 as the finance core slice after PHASE-001 platform, identity, PWA shell, and local stack proof reached review.

## Recent Decisions

- Use React + TypeScript with Vite, React Router, TanStack Query, PWA service worker, and IndexedDB.
- Use a Go modular monolith exposed as separate API and worker processes sharing domain/application packages.
- Use PostgreSQL as source of truth and private S3-compatible storage for receipts/exports.
- Use Google OAuth with a signed stateless cookie, no session table, and no linked-device management.
- Require explicit review before AI, OCR, webhook, or recurring drafts affect wallet balances.
- Use optimistic versions and explicit conflict review for full offline read/write.
- Keep receipt OCR and AI-chat images as distinct user flows.
- Restrict a hidden audit page to `AUDIT_VIEWER_EMAIL`; default retention is 180 days.
- Defer voice input until the seven initial release phases are verified.

## Queue Summary

- BL-001 through BL-007 comprise the initial release in dependency order.
- BL-008 is deferred voice input.
- All product requirements are accepted but remain unimplemented with planned proof only.

## Next Steps

1. Commit PHASE-002 finance-core ticket/design/plan artifacts.
2. Execute TICKET-005 wallet/category domain with migration and TDD.
3. Continue TICKET-006 transaction accounting engine after wallet/category foundation.

## Open Questions

These values are deployment inputs, not architecture blockers:

- Production `DATABASE_URL` and public application URL.
- Google OAuth client ID, secret, and redirect URL.
- S3 endpoint, bucket, region, and credentials.
- OpenAI-compatible base URL, text model, vision model, and key.
- OCR API base URL, authentication method, and response schema.
- Web Push VAPID keys.
- Verified Google email used for `AUDIT_VIEWER_EMAIL`.
